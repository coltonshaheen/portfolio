        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Looking back, I would say that my first experience teaching was in high school as a merit badge instructor
            for the Boy Scouts. When I enrolled in Towson University at age 18 I intended to earn a teaching degree and
            discovered as well, a pull toward military service and enrolled in Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC).
            I realized that teaching would have to come after my time in the military, as the certificate program at my
            university would have conflicted with my military science courses and obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My life has taken many turns since then. What has remained constant over these eight years, borne out since
            then through my work in multiple leadership positions and volunteer experiences, is my passion for teaching.
            From my military experience, which was shortcut by a medical discharge but nonetheless integral to my
            development, to my work for AmeriCorps with Habitat for Humanity, volunteering a community reading program,
            and other endeavors, I am clear on my pursuit of a master’s degree and teaching certification. One could say
            I have come full circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specifically look forward to teaching social studies as it is a subject I am deeply passionate about. I
            believe a knowledge of history and understanding of culture is crucial to a healthy society and to
            maintaining a democracy. An understanding of the social sciences is central to producing well-informed,
            civically-minded people. The study of government, history, economics, and psychology, among related
            disciplines, holds the potential to develop critical thinking. I intend to establish a classroom built on
            respect for knowledge, open discussion, and thoughtful scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
            What experiences will I bring to the table as an educator? I believe my background is unique. As a US Army
            Aviation student, I honed my academic skills in a high-stress, unconventional environment. Rote memorization
            coupled with real-life testing of survival skills, navigational principles, and flight concepts. After the
            onset of a disqualifying medical condition, I had to shift to an administrative role. I displayed
            significant leadership skills, so my supervisors tasked me with the management of my peers as a Student
            Management Officer. This role was often more difficult than the life-or-death decisions I had to make in the
            sky. I learned quickly how to support my fellow officers and help them through challenging career obstacles.
            As my career began to transition to civilian life, I shifted to the role of coach for classmates in similar
            situations. Officers in medical, legal, or administrative dilemmas were under my supervision. I developed
            strong relationships with others who felt that their career was coming to an end, helping to ease
            transitions or hasten their return to training. My commander recognized my service during my departure with
            the Army Achievement Medal.
        </p>
        <p>
            After my discharge, the draw of public service compelled me to begin volunteering. I began a term of service
            with AmeriCorps at Habitat for Humanity of Coastal Fairfield County (Habitat CFC). As a volunteer
            development VISTA (Volunteer in Service to America), I largely focused on transitioning the organization
            from a manual volunteer management process to a digital one. However, what I came to treasure was my
            involvement with Habitat CFC’s volunteer groups, including a women’s group and Youth United, a
            student-driven fundraising and homebuilding committee. In the year that I served, I developed strong
            relationships with the committee members who ranged in age from 13 to 18. I coached them as they planned and
            accomplished three separate fundraisers. I worked with them as they helped build a home for a Bridgeport, CT
            family. I discussed college plans and academic issues. These experiences helped secure my desire to work
            with students, particularly high school students, who approach a series of major crossroads.
        </p>
        <p>
            On my days off I worked with a local organization called New Haven Reads. One-on-one, I tutored three
            consecutive elementary school students on reading comprehension and writing skills. Witnessing an individual
            child’s academic transformation firsthand was something I had not experienced before. I realized how crucial
            my words, mannerisms, and actions were to the educational process. If I misspoke about an error or missed an
            opportunity to praise a success, I would often have to spend extra time to reengage the student. These
            lessons invigorated me, however, and I view this as a watershed moment in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is my dream to be a high school social studies teacher. All of these experiences shape the person I am
            and the educator I hope to become. I believe that I will excel in this program as I can persist through
            adversity, apply myself scholastically, and I have the tenacity to be the best possible educator, as that is
            what my students deserve.
